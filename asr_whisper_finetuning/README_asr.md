# SONIVA ASR Fine-Tuning – Whisper Medium

This folder contains resources and instructions for using the **fine-tuned Whisper Medium model** trained on the **SONIVA dataset**. The model has been fine-tuned by updating **all trainable parameters (encoder and decoder)** to improve transcription accuracy on post-stroke speech.

---

## 📄 Model Details
- **Base model:** Whisper Medium (OpenAI).
- **Fine-tuning:** Full fine-tuning (encoder + decoder parameters).
- **Training data:** SONIVA transcripts (patients speech only).
- **Goal:** Reduce word error rate (WER) for aphasic speech recognition.

## 📥 Download the Fine-Tuned Model (Manual)
The fine-tuned Whisper model is hosted on the Drive:

**🔗 [Download Whisper Medium – SONIVA Fine-Tuned Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lqyKebne8jIBaTeD9MjTh6M2Kf5hsbVW?usp=sharing)**

**Manual Step Required:**  
Due to its large size, you must **manually download and extract** the model folder.  
Once downloaded, place it in the following path:  
```bash
`asr_whisper_finetuning/models/whisper_soniva/`
```

## 🚀 Testing the Model
To test the fine-tuned model on your own `.wav` files, use the provided `test_asr.py` script.

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Audio Data**
- Ensure your test files are in `.wav` format.
- Recommended sample rate: **16 kHz** (the script automatically resamples).

### **Step 2: Run Transcription**
For a **directory of audio files**:
```bash
`python test_asr.py --model_path asr_whisper_finetuning/models/whisper_soniva --audio_dir path/to/wavs/ --output_file my_transcriptions.json`
```

Or for a **single file**:
```bash
`python test_asr.py --model_path asr_whisper_finetuning/models/whisper_soniva --audio_path sample.wav`
```

## 🧩 Pipeline Overview
The `test_asr.py` script performs the following steps:

1. **Load the fine-tuned model**  
```python
model, processor = WhisperForConditionalGeneration, WhisperProcessor
```
   Loads both model weights and the processor (tokenizer + feature extractor).

3. **Create dataset**  
   Converts audio files into a Hugging Face `Dataset` with proper 16 kHz sampling.

4. **Generate input features**  
   Uses the processor to extract log-Mel spectrograms required by Whisper.

5. **Inference**  
   Runs `model.generate()` to produce token predictions.

6. **Decode**  
   Converts token predictions to readable text using `processor.batch_decode`.

7. **Save results**  
   Transcriptions are stored in a `.json` file.

## 📊 Word Error Rate (WER) Evaluation (Optional)
If you have **reference transcripts**, you can compute WER using your preferred method.  
Before evaluation, ensure that you clean the transcriptions (e.g., **remove empty strings**, normalize casing and punctuation) to obtain accurate metrics.

Proceed with your normal WER calculation pipeline using the predicted `.json` file and your reference transcripts.
