# SONIVA: Speech recOgNItion Validation in Aphasia

This repository contains the code, models, and data developed for the **SONIVA project**.  
It includes **two main components**:

### 1. Acoustic Classification
We provide openSMILE-extracted acoustic features, along with machine learning models — **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and a **Neural Network (NN)** using focal loss and dropout regularization. These models are trained to classify speech segments as either **post-stroke (Patient)** or **healthy (Control)**, demonstrating the potential of acoustic biomarkers in clinical classification.

### 2. ASR Whisper Fine-Tuning
We release a **fine-tuned Whisper ASR model** trained on sentence-wise `.cha` transcripts derived from SONIVA recordings. These transcripts (but not raw audio) are included for benchmarking and adaptation, enabling the evaluation of **Word Error Rate (WER)** on post-stroke speech and supporting further research on clinical ASR performance.

## 📥 Data Access

All SONIVA datasets (acoustic features, metadata, ASR model, and transcripts) are hosted together:

**[🔗 Download SONIVA Data and Models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lqyKebne8jIBaTeD9MjTh6M2Kf5hsbVW?usp=sharing)**

The folder includes:
- `acoustic_features_with_id.xlsx` – Extracted acoustic features with subject IDs and labels.  
- `metadata.xlsx` – Clinical and demographic metadata (IC3 and PLORAS columns).  
- `.cha` transcript files – Orthographic and phonetic transcripts for ASR benchmarking.  
- Fine-tuned Whisper Medium model – Fully trained ASR model ready for testing.

## 🔐 Audio Data Access Policy (Controlled)

While acoustic features and transcripts are **openly available**, access to the **raw audio recordings** is restricted due to GDPR and ethical regulations. The audio files contain **biometric data (voice)** and are considered potentially re-identifiable.

To request access to the audio:

1. Download and review the [**SONIVA Data Usage Agreement (DUA)**](./DATA_USAGE_AGREEMENT_AUDIO.docx)
2. Sign the agreement and email it to **fatemeh.geranmayeh00@imperial.ac.uk** with:
   - Your institutional affiliation
   - A brief description of your intended research use
   - A valid **Good Clinical Practice (GCP)** training certificate 

Upon approval, secure access to the audio folder will be granted via the Drive.

Please note that access is limited to researchers affiliated with academic or healthcare institutions, and all use must comply with the conditions outlined in the DUA.
